"""
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2


Example 2:
Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1



Our solution returns the position of the target value within a nums array using the bisect function.
bisect_left returns the left most index if incase the target value is already present in the nums array.
